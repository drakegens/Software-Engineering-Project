<li>Need to clear up what is happening in Main.</li>
<li>Should we get rid of the CSVReader into Main?</li>
<li>That would result in a lot more code in Main.</li>
<li>It could still happen in CSVReader.</li>
<li>Where is the logic to pass around information?</li>
<li>Shoot for passing in a filename from commandline, then normalizes what it can.</li>
<li>Boolean determines what has been normalized and what has not.</li>
<li>Priority is the back-end, not getting a pretty GUI up and running.</li>
<li>Need to make sure each field is not empty in the normalization methods.</li>
<li>Distributed work to new user stories as more have been completed.</li>
<li>Need to write a Main.</li>
<li>Added user story to create Main.</li>
<li>Debated the structure of Main, what it would be doing.</li>
<li>Were CSVReader and CSVWriter mistakes?</li>
<li>Should CSVReader and CSVWriter be in main?</li>
<li>Is this still Main &amp; Subroutines architecture?</li>
<li>Heated debate over if these should be in Main or not.</li>
<li>Finally created main, named it AddNormBatch.</li>
<li>PM, DG, and AB will continue working with CSVReader, Main, because of familiarity.</li>
<li>YZ and AT will continue working with error handling and file output.</li>
<li>Decided to move everything (CSVReader and CSVWriter) into Main.</li>
