<p><b>A.</b> Actors</p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>A.1.</b> End Users</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>A.1.1</b> What human users, if any, does the system need to accommodate?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>A.1.2</b> Will the system need to accommodate different classes of users with
different permissions levels?</p>
   <p>&emsp;<b>A.2</b> Coupled Systems</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>A.2.1</b> What external systems, if any, does the system need to interoperate with?</p>
<p><b>B.</b> Typical Functionality</p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>B.1</b> Workflow</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.1.1</b> How does the system receive an address to be normalized?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.1.2</b> What results need to be returned or displayed after the system has processed and normalized an address?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.1.3</b> How should information about address receiving, address processing and results be communicated to human users? </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.1.3.1</b> If automated email, how should that email be formated and which users should receive it?</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.1.3.2</b> If GUI, web app or native app?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.1.4</b> Should information displayed be dependant on the class of the user, if any exist? </p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.1.4.1</b> If so, what which users need to see what?</p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>B.2</b> Address Handling Specifics </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.2.1</b> If an aspect of address is found to be invalid and repair is impossible, what
 should be done with the address?</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.2.2</b> If two aspects of an address such as zipcode and state are contradictory,
 what should be done with the address?</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.2.3</b> If non-alphanumeric characters are found within address how should they
be handled?</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>B.2.4</b> Is it appropriate to attempt to correct spelling errors in certain fields such as state or street address ending noun?</p>
<p><b>C.</b> Use Cases</p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>C.1</b> Batch Job </p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>C.1.1</b> What kind[a] of scheduling interfaces does the system need in this mode?</p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>C.2</b> Data Entry and Correction
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>C.2.1</b> Do we actively notify users about the corrections we make?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>C.2.2</b> What role should the user play in handling addresses that cannot be normalized?</p>
<p><b>D.</b> Non-functional</p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>D.1</b> Environment</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>D.1.1</b> What operating system does the system need to run on?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>D.1.2</b> Is it safe to assume that incoming data from other systems has been validated to have any null fields marked as such and a consistent field ordering? </p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>D.2</b> Constraints</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>D.2.1</b> Does the system need to handle security measures such as encrypting communication or authenticating users?</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>D.2.2</b> Is there a performance target in terms of normalized address per second or similar that needs to be met by the system?</p>
  <p>&emsp;<b>D.3</b> Other</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>D.3.1</b> If this project is to be open-sourced, which license would be most appropriate given how it will be used? </p>
