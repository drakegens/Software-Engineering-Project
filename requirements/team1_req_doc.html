<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to create a system for normalizing United States postal addresses which can be used for both batch processing input from CSV files and as a data-entry system. This system is needed by A. T. Still University for improving the quality of a database of medical faculty information. The delivery date is the week of May 2 2016.
</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The system implements a configurable rule parser that applies rules to a given address in order to normalize it. Users interact with the rules-engine backend through both a batch processing mode and an interactive data-entry mode. The batch-mode program is run from a command line interface. The interactive-mode allows for entering multiple addresses for processing. 
</p>

<h1>Functional Requirements</h1>
<p><b>1.</b> Interactive Mode </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>1.a.</b> The interactive-mode user shall be able to enter one U.S. address and receive the normalized result as long as the input is not an invalid address. (B.1, C.2) </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>1.b.</b> The interactive-mode user shall be able to resolve conflicts in normalizing a potentially normalizable address. (B.1, C.2) </p>
<p><b>2.</b> Batch Mode </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>2.a.</b> The batch-mode user shall be able to feed the system a CSV file and receive a batch of normalized addresses. (B.1.1, C.1) </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>2.b.</b> The system shall not halt for user input during a batch process. (C.1.2 R1) </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>2.c.</b> The system shall create a listing of potentially normalizable addresses with classification of their conflicts for later user review. (C.1, B.2) </p>
<p><b>3.</b> The user shall be notified if a duplicate address is generated by the normalizer. (B.2.5 R1)
  </p>
<p><b>4.</b> The system shall not make a valid address invalid. (B.2.4) </p>
<p><b>5.</b> The user shall be able to specify whether an address is a personal or business address. (B.1.6 R1) </p>
<p><b>6.</b> The system shall be able to normalize both personal and business addresses. (B.1.6 R1) </p>
<p><b>7.</b> The system shall not overwrite the input file. (B.1.3) </p>
<p><b>8.</b> The system shall preserve the order of input addresses in the output file. (D.2.3 R1) </p>
<p><b>9.</b> The system shall have limited error correction capability and present categories of error to the user. (B.2) </p>
<p><b>10.</b> The system shall not present invalid addresses as normalized addresses. (B.2) </p>

<h1>Nonfunctional Requirements</h1>
<p><b>1.</b> The system shall be cross platform and functional on Windows, Mac OS and Linux systems. (D.1.1) </p>
<p><b>2.</b> The system shall be non-interactive during a batch process. (C.1) </p>
<p><b>3.</b> The interactive-mode system shall not accept input with empty fields. (C.2) </p>
<p><b>4.</b> The batch-mode system shall be able to process up to 50,000 addresses in one pass. (D.2.2) </p>
<p><b>5.</b> The system shall be accessible through a graphical user interface for single address entry. (B.1.3.2) </p>
<p><b>6.</b> The system shall be accessible through the command line for batch process. (C.1)
</p>
