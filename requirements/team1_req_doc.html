<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to create a system for normalizing United States postal addresses which can be used for both batch processing input from CSV files and as an interactive system. This system is needed by A. T. Still University for improving the quality of a database of medical faculty information. The delivery date is the week of May 2 2016.
</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The system applies rules to a given address in order to normalize it. Users interact with the system through both a batch processing mode and an interactive mode. The batch mode program is run from a command line interface. The interactive mode allows for entering multiple addresses for processing. 
</p>

<h1>Functional Requirements</h1>
<p><b>A.1.</b> Interactive Mode </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>A.1.a.</b> The interactive-mode user shall be able to enter one U.S. address and receive the normalized result as long as the input is not an invalid address. (B.1, C.2) </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>A.1.b.</b> The interactive-mode user shall be able to resolve conflicts in normalizing a potentially normalizable address. (B.1, C.2) </p>
<p><b>2.</b> Batch Mode </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>A.2.a.</b> The batch-mode user shall be able to feed the system a CSV file and receive the normalized results. (B.1.1, C.1) </p>
<p>&emsp;<b>A.2.b.</b> The system shall create a listing of potentially normalizable addresses with classification of their conflicts for later user review. (C.1, B.2) </p>
<p><b>A.3.</b> The user shall be notified if a duplicate address is generated by the normalizer. (B.2.5 R1)
  </p>
<p><b>A.4.</b> The system shall not make a valid address invalid. (B.2.4) </p>
<p><b>A.5.</b> The user shall be able to specify whether an address is a personal or business address. (B.1.6 R1) </p>
<p><b>A.6.</b> The system shall be able to normalize both personal and business addresses. (B.1.6 R1) </p>
<p><b>A.7.</b> The system shall not overwrite the input file. (B.1.3) </p>
<p><b>A.8.</b> The system shall preserve the order of input addresses in the output file. (D.2.3 R1) </p>
<p><b>A.9.</b> The system shall have limited error correction capability and present categories of error to the user. (B.2) </p>
<p><b>A.10.</b> The system shall not present invalid addresses as normalized addresses. (B.2) </p>

<h1>Nonfunctional Requirements</h1>
<p><b>B.1.</b> The system shall be cross platform and functional on Windows, Mac OS and Linux systems. (D.1.1) </p>
<p><b>B.2.</b> The system shall be non-interactive during a batch process. (C.1) </p>
<p><b>B.3.</b> The interactive-mode system shall not accept input with empty fields. (C.2) </p>
<p><b>B.4.</b> The batch-mode system shall be able to process up to 50,000 addresses in one pass. (D.2.2) </p>
<p><b>B.5.</b> The system shall be accessible through a graphical user interface for single address entry. (B.1.3.2) </p>
<p><b>B.6.</b> The system shall be accessible through the command line for batch process. (C.1)
